First, you will learn about the Safe School Initiative, a study whose findings led to the development of the Assessment and Care Team Process. This training module draws heavily on the study’s findings and recommendations, taking directly from their published guidelines. Second, you will learn how to implement an Assessment and Care Team Process. It is critical to understand the principles, scope, and procedures that are the foundation of the Assessment and Care Team Process. Third, you will learn about the paramount preventative measure to targeted violence:  creating a safe school climate. You will learn steps you can take to increase trust and safety at school. Finally, the module concludes with a synthesis of all you learned. While you proceed through the training module, you will encounter quizzes that permit you to check your learning and reflect on module content. ",

Interestingly, the Safe School Initiative was modeled after the Secret Service’s earlier study on the thinking and behaviors of individuals who carried out or attempted lethal attacks on public officials or prominent individuals in the United States since 1949.

The Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (OTVTP) helps everyone remain safe by working with local communities to develop local prevention frameworks. These frameworks build protective factors that dissuade individuals from radicalizing to violence and address risk factors that may make an individual more susceptible to radicalizing to violence. One of those risk factors is social isolation. Social isolation (whether voluntary or not, short-term or long-term) may impact a child’s mental health. These mental health issues may result in a decline of social cohesion and social capital which may increase an individual’s willingness to accept messages of radicalization to violence.",
