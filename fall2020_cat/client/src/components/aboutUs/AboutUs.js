                    When a person commits an act of targeted violence at school, the act often involves significant 
                    planning. Schools can support their community and help prevent acts of targeted violence by 
                    establishing an “Assessment and Care Team,” also known as a “Behavioral Intervention Team” or 
                    a “Threat Assessment Team.” This interface provides a condensed overview of a school Assessment 
                    and Care Team. It outlines how a school or school district can form and operate an Assessment 
                    and Care Team. The content is based on information published by the U.S. Secret Service National 
                    Threat Assessment Center.
